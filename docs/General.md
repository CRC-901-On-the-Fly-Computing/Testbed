## General
Collaborative Research Centre 901: On-the-fly Computing
-------------------------------------------------------

The objective of CRC 901 -- On-The-Fly Computing (OTF Computing) -- is to develop techniques and processes for automatic on-the-fly configuration and provision of individual IT services out of base services that are available on world-wide markets. In addition to the configuration by special OTF service providers and the provision by so-called OTF Compute Centers, this involves developing methods for quality assurance and the protection of participating clients and providers, methods for the target-oriented further development of markets, and methods to support the interaction of the participants in dynamically changing markets.

#### Proof of Concept
[TODO Christian] Describe how the PoC is related to the CRC901
* Which component is related to which subproject?
* Example for PoC usage
* Screenshot(s)


#### Regular meetings [TODO move into Wiki!?]
* Developer meeting weekly - Friday 9.00 am CET
[TODO in general, I think we should make sure that the information contained in the docs folder is not "UPB specific"]


### Contributing to the PoC

#### Usage of issue tracker
[TODO Christian] This should be about reporting bugs and contributing to the PoC. Thus, we need info about branching, issues, and licensing (more?). Should this be moved into an own file?

### Preliminary tasks [TODO move into Wiki!?]

#### Get permissions from IRB [TODO move into Wiki!?]
